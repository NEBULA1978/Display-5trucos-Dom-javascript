In the video, the following topics related to the display property in HTML and CSS are covered:

**Default Display of HTML Tags:** It's explained that each HTML tag has a default display value. For instance, header tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.) have a display block value, while link tags (a) and span tags are of inline type. It also mentions the inline-block value for elements like buttons, images, and form inputs.

**Incorrect Uses of Display:** It demonstrates how errors are often made when changing the display of elements, such as converting block elements into inline-block to avoid space between them. Then, it highlights that this isn't a suitable solution and suggests using other properties, such as vertical-align, to solve alignment issues.

**The Case of display: none:** It explains how to hide elements using display: none and how this affects the representation on the page. It shows that when display: none is applied, the element disappears and doesn't occupy space on the page. It also mentions the visibility property as an alternative that keeps the space occupied by the hidden element.

**Automatic Display Change:** It shows how certain properties, such as float or flex, can modify the display of elements without the need to manually change it. For example, applying display: flex to a container makes the inner elements become flex elements, allowing for a more flexible and automatic layout.

**Example Using display: flex with Media Queries:** It demonstrates how display: flex can be used along with media queries to create responsive layouts. An example is shown where elements are rearranged and change direction based on the width of the browser window.

The video provides practical examples and detailed explanations of these concepts. You can complement this information with additional examples and practices if you want to delve deeper into using the display property in HTML and CSS.
